<h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a passionate learner, creator, and engineer. I have been inspired by the mentors I have had along my journey and I want to transform my passion into a profession. This is why I am professionally studying engineering and getting involved wherever I can. I am looking for a career that will challenge me to grow as a person and engineer. I have been working on engineering related projects for years; from robotics to inventing wildfire prevention devices I have tried my best to work on it all and continue to do so. On these projects I have acted as a lead engineer, technical lead, and project manager where I led my teams to complete large projects and reach our goals. I am experienced in Computer Aided Design with SolidWorks, I have written plenty of programs in C++, I have designed PCB's in Altium, and I am actively learning newer and better technical skills. </p>
