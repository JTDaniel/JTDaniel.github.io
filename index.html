      <p>Welcome to my homepage, and prepare to explore! Take a journey through my experiences, goals, and projects.  My name is Travis Daniel, I am a young engineer at work, looking <b>for</b> work.</p></span>
      <p>I have always loved to create! When most kids wanted to be a football player, a rockstar, the president... I wanted to be an inventor.  I took that young dream and ran with it.  I was exposed to organizations like FIRST Robitics, Students for Exploration and Development of Space, and Lemelson-MIT.  Giving my first dive into the world of real making.</p>
      <p>I also learned to play! Play with toys like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, 3D Printers, Machining Tools, and more recently HTML/CSS/Python (Welcome to one of those sessions).</p>
      <p>I was inspired to study engineering professionally.  Currently a student at Arizona State University, I am studying Electrical Engineering. A degree that can bring me one step closer to working on ever more exciting projects and technnologies.  Set to graduate Spring of 2024, I am ready to break out into industry and take my shot at doing things bigger and better</p>
