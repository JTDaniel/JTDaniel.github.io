      <br>
      <p>Are you looking for fresh blood? A lifetime learner? Looking for someone adaptable, motivated, and persistent? Then you have come to the right place! I am a soon to graduate Electrical Engineering Student at Arizona State University. I have a passion for creation and a love for learning. I have industry experience from my role as an intern and have spent many years learning, designing, and creating outside of the industry, This includes my 4 years of work on a Competitive FIRST Robotics competition team, 3 years working as a lead for the ASU Makerspace, and the variety of personal electronics projects and tinkering I've done.
        Most recently I have worked at Diamond Age 3D as an Electrical Engineering Intern where I received much exposure to industry processes, particularly in the automation and controls sector. Through this experience, I gathered skills in technical documentation, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), and the Python programming language. 
        At the ASU Maker Space, I had the opportunity to consult with students, build various electronics, design and host workshops, and repair equipment like 3D printers, laser cutters, vinyl cutters, cameras, and sewing machines.
        Also with the university, I worked as a circuits lab teaching assistant. Here I got additional experience with lab equipment, teaching, technical documentation, and troubleshooting. I wrote much of the documentation for this lab and helped to reshape ASU's circuits lab class for future students.</p>
